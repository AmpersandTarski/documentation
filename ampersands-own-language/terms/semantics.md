# Semantics

The semantics of the operators can be discussed in many different ways. We want to include  a number of different ways of explaining in the following table: one explanation in terms of logic, one in set theory, one in terms of axioms \(algebraically\) and one visual explanation. The advice to a novice is to learn just one way of explaining, whichever one suits the prior knowledge best.
