# Relational operators in algebra

## Purpose of relational operators

To say things such as "the name of the owner", we want to string together multiple relations \(viz. `name` and `owner`\). Relational operators allow us to make such statements.

## Converse

There are two things you should know about the converse operator. The first is that the converse of the converse gives you the relation itself, whatever that relation may be:

$$
{r\smallsmile}\smallsmile\ =\ r
$$

The second is that arguments switch places if the converse is brought outside \(or inside\) brackets

$$
r\smallsmile ; s\smallsmile\ =\ (s;r)\smallsmile
$$

## Composition

The composition operator is denoted by a semicolon ; between two terms. It is pronounced as 'composed with', in this case: $$r$$ composed with $$s$$.

The composition is associative, which means:

$$
r;(s;t)\ =\ (r;s);t
$$

The meaning stays the same, no matter how you place the brackets. So Ampersand lets you omit brackets entirely. You may simply write $$r;s;t$$.
