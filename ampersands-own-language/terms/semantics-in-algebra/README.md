# Semantics in algebra

The boolean operators of Ampersand behave as one would expect in any boolean algebra. Union \($$\cup$$\) and intersection \($$\cap$$\) are both commutative and associative operators. In Ampersand we use a binary difference operator over with the usual semantics: $$(r-s)\cup(r\cap s) = r$$. The \(more customary\) complement operator is a partial function, because Ampersand supports heterogeneous relation algebra.

This chapter discusses the [boolean operators](boolean-operators-in-algebra.md) in the following section.
