# Boolean operators in algebra

In any interpretation, the boolean operators $$\cap$$ \(intersect\) and $$\overline{\strut}$$ \(complement\) will satisfy

1. \(commutativity of $$\cup$$\)     $$r\cup s\ =\ s\cup r$$
2. \(associativity of $$\cup$$\)        $$r\cup (s\cup t)\ =\ (r\cup s)\cup t$$
3. \(complement \)     $$\overline{\overline{r}\cup s}\cup\overline{\overline{r}\cup\overline{s}}\ =\ r$$

These rules are the axioms of boolean algebra according to Huntington \[1933\]
