## Installing and running a prototype website
Installing a prototype consists of copying the generated contents into the `htdocs` directory of the webserver. (you will find the proto directory at the same location as where you have _myModel.adl_. This can be configured using a switch or using the environment variables)

Running a prototype consists of making sure that the webserver and database server are running, and then calling (this directory on) the webserver from any web browser such as firefox, or chrome. Other browsers may also work.
