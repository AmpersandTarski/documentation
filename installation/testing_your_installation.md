## Testing your installation
 * Open a [command prompt](http://www.c3scripts.com/tutorials/msdos/open-window.html).
 * Type "Ampersand --version". The expected behaviour is that Ampersand replies with the version of Ampersand. It will look something like:
```
C:> ampersand.exe --version
Ampersand v3.1.0[master:2fa348f*], build time: 08-Sep-15 14:04:58 West-Europa (z
omertijd)
```
The version number is important to specify, whenever you have a question of like to report an issue. It **really** helps us when you add the version number, **including everything between the brackets** when you contact us.
