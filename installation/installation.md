# How to avoid installing Ampersand
Just go to http://ampersand.tarski.nl/RAP3. Register and get started right away. At no cost (for you, for now).

# On your own laptop
You can also install the software on computers of your own. For different purposes there are different ways of installing Ampersand:

1. If you just want the executable file `Ampersand.exe`, section [Installing Ampersand](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ampersandtarski/documentation/edit#) tells you how you get it.
2. If you want to run prototypes on your own computer, follow the instructions in section [Installing and running a prototype](/installation/installing_and_running_a_prototype_website.md). For running a prototype on your own computer, it needs a webserver that can run javascript, PHP7 \(often PHP5.6 or later will do fine\), the PHP composer, and a \(My\)SQL or MariaDB database server.
3. For generating functional specification documents you will need GraphViz \(for generating graphics such as conceptual models and data models\), and LaTeX.
4. For compiling the Ampersand compiler you need access to the source files, and a Haskell development environment. Since this setup is also needed for those for whom no pre-built Ampersand.exe file is available. Details on how to set this up can be found in the section [Installing Ampersand](/installing_ampersand.html).

## On a server
If you run a class or have a team at work, you might want a RAP3 clone of your own rather than work from http://ampersand.tarski.nl/RAP3.
In that case, consult [the tools we use at Ampersand](https://ampersandtarski.gitbooks.io/the-tools-we-use-for-ampersand/content/installation_of_rap.html). This is work in progress.

The remainder of this chapter explains in detail all the things you need to get you up and running with Ampersand. The instructions presume that you are familiar with your own computers.
