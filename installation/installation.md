# Installation



## Windows
[a pretty recent windows binary](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AmpersandTarski/webFiles/master/executables/windows/ampersand.exe) can be downloaded for windows. We try to update it pretty often, using a git repository for that purpose. 

## Mac OS X

## Linux

## Installing from Source
If for some reason a binary package is not available for your platform, you can install from source:

 * First, install the [Haskell platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
 * then use the cabal tool to get the latest release of pandoc:

```
cabal update
cabal install ampersand
```

Of course, when you are familiar with Git, you could clone the [ampersand repository](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/ampersand) to get the current development version.
