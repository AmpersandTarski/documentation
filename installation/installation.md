# Installation

The installation of Ampersand depends a bit on what you want to do with it. There are roughly three distinct kinds of installations that you may want to have (or combine), namely for
1. generating and running prototypes;
2. generating functional specification documents;
3. generating (compiling) the ampersand tooling itself (this is for those that want to help develop Ampersand software itself).

**All users** will need the executable file `Ampersand.exe`. The section [Installing Ampersand](/installation/installing_ampersand.html) tells you how you get it.

**For generating and running prototypes** you also need a webserver that can run javascript, PHP7 (often PHP5 will do fine), and a (My)SQL database server. The section [Installing and running a prototype](/installation/installing_and_running_a_prototype_website.html) has the instructions.

**For generating functional specification documents** you will need GraphViz (for generating graphics such as conceptual models and data models), and LaTeX. 

**For compiling the Ampersand software itself** you need access to the source files, and a Haskell development environment. Since this setup is also needed for those for whom no pre-built Ampersand.exe file is available, details on how to set this up can be found in the section [Installing Ampersand](./installation/installing_ampersand.html).

This chapter explains the things you need to get you up and running with Ampersand.
