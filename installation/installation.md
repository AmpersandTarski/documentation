# Installation

If you want to install Ampersand, you can choose one of the following alternatives:

1. Choose this alternative if you want to write Ampersand-scripts and compile them on your own computer. You need a pre-built executable file, which we offer for both Windows and Mac. You also need GraphViz if you want Ampersand to generate graphics. Examples of such graphics are conceptual models and data models. You also need LaTeX if you want to generate documents in LaTeX. Finally you need a local webserver and MySQL-server to use Ampersand's prototyping capability.
2. The alternative is to compile an executable file yourself. This is necessary if you want to help develop Ampersand software or if your computer cannot deal with any of the pre-built executables. In this case, you need a Haskell development environment.

In this chapter, we will explain what you need to get you up and running with Ampersand.
