# Installation

The installation of Ampersand depends a bit on what you want to do with it. There are roughly three distinct kinds of installations that you may want to have (or combine), namely for
1. generating and running prototypes;
2. generating functional specification documents;
3. generating (compiling) the ampersand tooling itself (this is not for beginners).

**All users** will need the executable file `Ampersand.exe`. The chapter [Installing Ampersand](./installation/installing_ampersand.html) tells you how you get it.

**For generating and running prototypes** you also need a webserver that can run javascript, PHP7 (often PHP5 will do fine), and a (My)SQL database server. The chapter [Installing and running a prototype](/installation/installing_and_running_a_prototype_website.html) has the instructions.

**For generating functional specification documents** you will need GraphViz (for generating graphics such as conceptual models and data models), and LaTeX. 

2. The alternative is to build an executable file yourself, starting from the source files. Pick this alternative if you want to help develop Ampersand software or if your computer cannot deal with the pre-built executable. In this case, you need a Haskell development environment.

This chapter explains the things you need to get you up and running with Ampersand.
