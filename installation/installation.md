# Installation

If you want to install Ampersand, you need to distinguish in which situation you are in:

1. You want to write Ampersand-scripts and compile them on your own computer. In this case you need an executable file compile with. You also need GraphViz if you want Ampersand to generate graphics. Examples of such graphics are conceptual models and data models. You also need LaTeX if you want to generate documents in LaTeX. Finally you need a local webserver and MySQL-server, to use Ampersand's prototyping capability.
2. You want to change the Ampersand software, to contribute to the development of Ampersand. In this case you need a Haskell development environment.

In this chapter, we will explain what you need to get you up and running with Ampersand.
