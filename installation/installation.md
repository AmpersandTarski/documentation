# Installation

If you want to install an Ampersand-compiler on your own computer, you can choose one of the following alternatives:

1. In case you want to write Ampersand-scripts and compile them on your own computer, you will need a executable file called "ampersand.exe". This is the pre-built Ampersand compiler. It exists for Windows and Mac. You also need GraphViz if you want Ampersand to generate graphics. Examples of such graphics are conceptual models and data models. You also need LaTeX if you want to generate documents in LaTeX. Finally you need a local webserver and MySQL-server to use Ampersand's prototyping capability.
2. The alternative is to build an executable file yourself, starting from the source files. Pick this alternative if you want to help develop Ampersand software or if your computer cannot deal with the pre-built executable. In this case, you need a Haskell development environment.

This chapter explains the things you need to get you up and running with Ampersand.
