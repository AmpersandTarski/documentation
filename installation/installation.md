# Install Ampersand
You can also install the software on computers of your own. For different purposes there are different ways of installing Ampersand:

1. If you just want the executable file `Ampersand.exe`, section [Installing Ampersand](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ampersandtarski/documentation/edit#) tells you how you get it.
2. If you want to run prototypes on your own computer, follow the instructions in section [Installing and running a prototype](/installation/installing_and_running_a_prototype_website.md). For running a prototype on your own computer, it needs a webserver that can run javascript, PHP7 \(often PHP5.6 or later will do fine\), and a \(My\)SQL or MariaDB database server.
3. For generating functional specification documents you will need GraphViz \(for generating graphics such as conceptual models and data models\), and LaTeX.
4. For compiling the Ampersand software itself you need access to the source files, and a Haskell development environment. Since this setup is also needed for those for whom no pre-built Ampersand.exe file is available. Details on how to set this up can be found in the section [Installing Ampersand](/installing_ampersand.html).

This chapter explains the things you need to get you up and running with Ampersand.
