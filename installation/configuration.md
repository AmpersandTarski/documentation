## Configuration

After you have installed ampersand, make sure to follow the steps below, to get you on your way:

### Setting your path
Make sure ampersand.exe can be found, by putting it somewhere in you path. [See how you set Windows $PATH variable](http://youtu.be/9UFNdFw9KHs)

### Other environment variables
Optionally, you may want to set some other environment variables. Have a look at the section [Environment Variables](../command-line-interface/environment-variables.md) to see what variables exist.
