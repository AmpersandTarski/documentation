## About Ampersand
The purpose of Ampersand is to help you develop information systems that actually do what its intended users want them to do. It allows you to offer information systems to the business that provably comply to the rules by which they conduct their business. How cool is that!

Using Ampersand allows you to communicate to the business its own jargon in order to understand its ways of working. You make your understanding explicit by writing it down in rules and interface specifications. Then, Ampersand generates a real and working prototype of the information system. Both you and business users may exercise this application. Together you judge whether or not the prototype exhibits all desired functionalities. After a few iterations, the prototype will demonstrate that you have actually understood the business requirements. If needed, you can then still generate a document containing the functional specifications for this information system, that professional IT-engineers can use to construct a business grade application from. However, for small applications the prototype may well serve the business purpose already...

The design of the Ampersand language has a particular philosophy. You will work with [business rules](http://www.businessrulesgroup.org/brmanifesto/BRManifesto.pdf). This lets you communicate effectively with users and other business stakeholders. The language Ampersand consists of the following elements:
1. The language is **strongly and statically typed**. This helps a programmer to write correct code and enables an efficient implementation of that code.
2. The language is **based on relation algebra**, because relation algebra has two useful interpretations. One interpretation is in natural language. That helps to involve business stakeholders. The other interpretation is working software. That is necessary to generate a web application and its database directly from an Ampersand script.
3. The language is **[declarative](/why-declarative.md "Why Declarative?")**. This yields clarity in the semantics.
4. The language offers **incremental development**. The programmer makes progress by adding restrictions. At any point he can generate software and use that as a working prototype for the definitive information system.
5. The language offers **compositionality**. Each system is a composition of design patterns. As a result, larger systems can be assembled from parts. Each part can be developed independently and reused.
6. Documentation can be embedded in the specification.
