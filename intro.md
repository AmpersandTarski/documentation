# Introduction

Want to avoid reading too much? Take a moment to think about this:

## What makes you curious?...

1. I'm just interested to know who might use Ampersand and for which purposes. [Click here](why-ampersand/) to learn why you might want Ampersand.
2. I am a _student_ wanting to use Ampersand in class. [This tutorial](tutorial-rap3/) was made just for you. Students who like something different will love it.
3. I am a _computer professional_ in need of a good method for designing an information system. Computer professionals who like fast results will be thrilled, provided they make the effort of learning.
4. I am a _scientific researcher_ and I want to know about the [theory behind Ampersand](ampersands-own-language/terms/). Scientists who like formal methods will appreciate this particular use of relation algebra.
5. I am a _software engineer_ and I want to change Ampersand to suit my needs. You'll be delighted to see that your back-end software is as adaptable as your front-end software, and everything is generated towards proven technology for the sake of maintainable results.
6. I _work in an industry, an enterprise, or a government institute_ and I want to enhance my business. Ampersand is not interesting for you, unless you might need correct enterprise software, fast development, and you have smart enough engineers who are business oriented.

## Disclaimer

Ampersand is a project with no funds. The people who are supporting Ampersand are volunteers with little spare time. This explains why there are omissions in this text. So please condone any shortcomings. We are looking for skilled volunteers to help this project forward, by the way.
