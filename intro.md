## ... to read the Ampersand documentation
To actually read the documentation, please click on the green `Read` button at the top right hand of this page, or download the PDF. 

Currently, the focus of this documentation is primarily on how to use this language and the software that supports it. While this focus may change over time, we currently do not have such intentions.

The purpose of the include here below is that the summary is printed at the front page.

## About Ampersand
The purpose of Ampersand is to help you develop information systems that actually do what its intended users want. Ampersand allows you to communicate to such users in their business jargon. It lets you formalize the rules of the business. And it saves you a lot of effort programming this stuff in software, because Ampersand will do that for you. The prize for the business is provable compliance of the software to the rules of the business proper. How cool is that!

The design of the Ampersand language has a particular philosophy. You will work with [business rules](http://www.businessrulesgroup.org/brmanifesto/BRManifesto.pdf). This lets you communicate effectively with users and other business stakeholders. The language Ampersand consists of the following elements:
1. The language is **strongly and statically typed**. This helps a programmer to write correct code and enables an efficient implementation of that code.
2. The language is **based on relation algebra**, because relation algebra has two useful interpretations. One interpretation is in natural language. That helps to involve business stakeholders. The other interpretation is working software. That is necessary to generate a web application and its database directly from an Ampersand script.
3. The language is **declarative**. This yields clarity in the semantics, which do not rely on side effects.
4. The language offers **incremental development**. The programmer makes progress by adding restrictions. At any point he can generate software and use that as a working prototype for the definitive information system.
5. The language offers **compositionality**. Each system is a composition of design patterns. As a result, larger systems can be assembled from parts. Each part can be developed independently and reused.
6. Documentation can be embedded in the specification.
