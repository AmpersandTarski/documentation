## About Ampersand

The purpose of Ampersand is to help business architects deliver. Ampersand lets you design information systems that actually do what users want. It allows you to offer information systems to the business that provably comply to the rules by which they conduct their business. And it lets you work fast. How cool is that!

How does it work?

1. Communicate with the business in their own language. Define a _domain language[^1]_ to consolidate agreement of terms among stakeholders. Ampersand formalizes part of the business language  that is used in the information system. Ampersand gives you a \(documented\) ontology.  
2. Generate a real and working _prototype_ of your information system at the push of a button. Use this prototype for walking through user stories, acceptance testing, requirements elicitations, to name just some of its uses.
3. Express your design in [_business rules_](http://www.businessrulesgroup.org/brmanifesto/BRManifesto.pdf) rather than steps to be executed by a computer.
4. Define your information system in a [_declarative_](/why-declarative.md "Why Declarative?") language. Ampersand gives you correctness and consistency in return, with mathematical provability to back it up.
5. Enjoy the benefits of _strong and static typing_. Several scientific studies show significant effects of strong and static typing on the total cost of ownership of your design. Besides, it enables Ampersand to generate efficient code.  
6. Use _relation algebra_ to align the IT-system to the business, by exploiting two useful interpretations of relation algebra. One interpretation is in natural language. That helps to involve business stakeholders. The other interpretation is working software. That is necessary to generate a web application and its database directly from an Ampersand script. Ampersand gives more certainty that your system complies with the business requirements.
7. Develop in _small increments_. Add constraints, user-interfaces, relations, and other design elements one at a time. Generate a prototype at any intermediate stage, to visualize your design long before it is finished.  
8. Design subsystems[^2] in isolation, due to _conceptual independence_. Ampersand lets you combine subsystems into larger systems, automating the burden of combining them.  Reuse _design patterns_ to assemble systems, rather than re-invent from scratch. 
9. Document your design embedded in the specification, so you always have up-to-date _documentation_ which is consistent with your design.
