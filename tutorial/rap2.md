This section introduces the tool you will use during the tutorial: RAP2. This tool stores Ampersand-scripts in which you can specify, analyze and build information systems. It runs in the cloud, so all you need is a browser and [click here](http://is.cs.ou.nl/rap2) to start using it.

## Identifying yourself

RAP2 keeps your work together under a student number. So you have to log in in the system under your own student number. The first time you have to register and leave your e-mail.

## Making your first Ampersand script

When you click on the blue plus-sign on the right side in the menu bar in your screen, you get to make a new script. It opens an editor screen in which you can type your very first own Ampersand script. You might for example cut the "Hawaii" script from this tutorial and paste it in the editor. If you scroll downwards, you will get controls to compile and use it. Note that Ampersand is complicated software, so please have a little patience after pushing one of its buttons.![](/assets/your first Ampersand script.png)

## Assignment

Use RAP3 to make changes to "Hawaii". Try for instance to register a teacher for each course. Be sure to compile and run your script and demonstrate to each other that your change works.
