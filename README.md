# Documentation of Ampersand

This repository contains the documentation of Ampersand. Currently, it is far from complete. However, since we use GitBook, it has become easier to add to it. 

## Read it online
We have an automatic toolchain in use, that generates the online documentation each time a modification is done to the master branch of the book. 

## How to add/modify this documentation

Of course, you could use your own way of working with markdown. However, there is a great editor that goes with Gitbook. How to use it and how to get going with it can be found in the [this document](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ampersandtarski/the-tools-we-use-for-ampersand/details)
