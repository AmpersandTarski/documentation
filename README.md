# Documentation of Ampersand

This repository contains the documentation of Ampersand. Currently, it is far from complete. However, since we use GitBook, it has become easier to add to it. 

## Read it online
We have an automatic tool chain in use. It updates a [site with the documentation](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ampersandtarski/documentation) each time a modification is done to the master branch of the book. 

## How to add/modify this documentation

By far the easiest way is to use the online editor that goes with Gitbook. How to use it and how to get going with it can be found in the [this document](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ampersandtarski/the-tools-we-use-for-ampersand)

If you are in doubt on how to use it, or you would like a demo, ask Han!
