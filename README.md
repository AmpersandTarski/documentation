# Documentation of Ampersand

This repository contains the documentation of Ampersand. It is far from complete. but, since we use GitBook, it has become easier to add to it.

To try Ampersand, you can use an online Ampersand environment such as RAP. If you do not have access to such an environment, you may want to [install Ampersand](https://ampersandtarski.gitbooks.io/documentation/content/installation/installation.html). You can choose to install Ampersand to use [the command-line interface, which isn't exposed online](https://ampersandtarski.gitbooks.io/documentation/content/command-line-interface/command-line-interface.html).

Do you already have access to Ampersand? Or do you not wish to install it? Then read [about modeling in Ampersand](https://ampersandtarski.gitbooks.io/documentation/content/modeling/modeling_in_ampersand.html).

## How to modify this documentation

We have an automatic tool chain in use. It updates a [site with the documentation](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ampersandtarski/documentation) each time the master branch of the book is modified. 

By far the easiest way is to use the online editor that goes with Gitbook. How to use it and how to get going with it can be found in the [this document](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ampersandtarski/the-tools-we-use-for-ampersand).

If you are in doubt on how to use it, or you would like a demo, ask Han!
