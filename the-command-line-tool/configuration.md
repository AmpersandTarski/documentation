# Configuration

ampersand.exe can be configured in several ways. [Options](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/documentation/tree/5c45435a2b5cdd69129ba6ee9401819331fb531e/the-command-line-tool/options.md) can be used to tell what artifacts to generate, and all kinds of other useful things. You can add a configuration file in the the same directory as your model, so you don't have to remember all these switches each time you call ampersand.exe.
