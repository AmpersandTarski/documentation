This tutorial is meant for Business- or IT-professionals who want to learn about information systems development. Knowledge about Ampersand is not presumed. The text offers pointers for you to find out many things on your own. This tutorial is intended for use in a classroom, because a tutor is required to explain details that are missing in this tutorial. The required theory is also available in chapter 3 of[ the coursebook](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.127.1930&rep=rep1&type=pdf) of [a course given at the Open University of the Netherlands](http://portal.ou.nl/web/rule-based-design-for-cs/cursusinformatie). This tutorial also contains assignments to let you practice.

## Overview

1. You will start by [looking at an information system called "Hawaii"](/tutorial/what-is-an-information-system.md) and learn the basics of its specification. By looking at a small, yet complete information system you can discuss the purpose of the course with your tutor and peers.
2. Then you will be [introduced to the web-based version of Ampersand](/tutorial/rap3.md), RAP3, in which you can specify your own information system. With this tool, you can make information systems of your own, enabling you to complete the course.
3. You will [learn how to analyse a "spreadsheet information system"](/tutorial/data-in-spreadsheets.md) and turn it into a well defined information system. This technique allows you to help organizations by organizing and structuring data
4. You will [learn how to add rules to your data](/tutorial/rules.md). This will allow you to add meaning to your information system, because you can assure your user community that these rules will remain satisfied.
