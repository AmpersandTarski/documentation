# Semantics

The semantics of the operators can be discussed in many different ways.  The following table contains a number of different ways of explaining: one explanation in terms of logic, one in set theory, one in terms of axioms \(algebraically\), one in natural language and one visual explanation. The advice to a novice is to start with the natural language explanation, and to read other explanations only if it suits the prior knowledge.
