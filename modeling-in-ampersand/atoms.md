# Atoms

## Purpose

The purpose for having atoms is to identify things uniquely.

## Description

An atom refers to an individual object in the real world, such as the student called "Caroline". But what if there are three different Carolines? What does it mean to say: "Caroline has passed the exam for Spanish Medieval Literature."? This sentence might be true for one Caroline, but false for the others. Clearly, to avoid ambiguous sentences, an atom must identify exactly one real-world object, no more, no less. Or rather, it suffices that the atom identifies one object within the context in which we are working: if the context is a group with only one Caroline, there will be no ambiguity. Similarly, ABBA is unique among all pop groups in the world; there ought to be only one building permit with number 5678; etcetera.

## Examples

`"Caroline"`, `5`, `"12 October 1376"` `48`, `10.34`, `2.`, `.001`, `-125`, `+5.33333`, `2.5E2`, `5E-3`
