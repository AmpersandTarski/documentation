# The Population statement

## Semantics
There are two ways to populate a concept with atoms: 
* The POPULATION statement in the adl-file
* The INCLUDE statement to include an xlsx-file

The first method is laborious, so when you intend to change the population several times, the xlsx-method is easier.

## Syntax
You can define atoms separately, but you can skip that and define the tuples in a relation. The list of tuples is a comma-separated list between square brackets. Tuples are comma-separated pairs between round brackets. Each atom is enclosed in double quotes.
