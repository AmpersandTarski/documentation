# Prototypes

Ampersand allows you to generate a working prototype of your ampersand model. An Ampersand prototype is a website that requires a webserver to run on and a (My)SQL database server. This chapter describes the prerequisites for getting such prototypes up, and running.

## Quick start
As part of the installation instructions, a sample of getting a tiny prototype to work is given.
