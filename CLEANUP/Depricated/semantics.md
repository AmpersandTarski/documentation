# Semantics of Ampersand

## \(under construction\)

Given:  
1. a set of concepts `C`  
2. a set of relations `R`. Every element of `R` has shape `r[P*Q]`, in which `r` is called the _name_, `P` is called the _source_, and `Q` is called the _target_.  
3. `r[P*Q]` in `R` implies that `P` in `C` and `Q` in `C`.  
4. four predicates on relations, `uni`, `inj`, `tot`, `sur`.  
5. a set of tables `T`  
6. a set of attributes `A`. Every element of `A` has shape `a<t,c>`, in which `a` is called the _name_, `t` is called the _table_, and `c` is called the _type_.  
7. `a<t,c>` in `A` implies that `t` in `T` and `c` in `C`.
