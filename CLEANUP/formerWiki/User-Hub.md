# Ampersand User Hub
The **purpose of the Ampersand User Hub** is help you 
* write Ampersand scripts;
* generate Ampersand prototypes and run them;
* generate functional specifications.

**THIS PAGE IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS**

-------------------
## Writing Ampersand Scripts

In order to write Ampersand scripts, you should already
* have a working text editor (any one will do),
* know where to find the [Ampersand Syntax Reference](Ampersand-Syntax-Reference), and
* know how to write Ampersand rules in relation algebra (learn this at the [Student Hub](Student-Hub)). 



## Generating an Ampersand Prototype
In order to generate an Ampersand prototype, you need 
* a script from which to generate the prototype (see "Writing Ampersand Scripts" above),
* the [Ampersand generator](Download-Ampersand), and
* a [web server with some additional capabilities](Ampersand-Web-Server-Installation) on which to run the prototype.


## Generating a Functional Specification
In order to generate a fuctional specification, you should 
* a script from which to generate the functional specification,
* the [Ampersand generator](Download-Ampersand), and
* a [running LaTeX environment with some additional capabilities](Ampersand-LaTeX-Installation) to create the actual (PDF) document.
