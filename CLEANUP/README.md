# Please clean the former wiki into the documentation repository

## Why a new way of structuring our documenting?
* New repository gives the possibility to store assets and documentation pages in a structured way. 
* Structuring our documentation in 'chapter-like' parts, makes it easier for our readers to find what they are looking for. 
* It gives version control the way we are used to, using GIT
* all kinds of other benefits on the longer time, as stated in issue#1
* You can now edit the paged directly on github (as in the wiki), but now also locally, with your favorite markdown tools


## How to migrate?
* For all content in this directory, 
   1. Think about in what chapter it should go. Be critical when you start a new chapter..
   1. Move the content (or parts, at your own judgement) to the appropriate place.
   1. delete the content you moved from this directory. 
   1. that's all, finally all content in this directory will be gone. Then it can be deleted.
