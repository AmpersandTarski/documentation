publisher={Springer},

volume={6051},
pages={68-82},
abstract={Duplication of data across systems in an organization is a problem because it wastes effort and leads to inconsistencies. Researchers have proposed several technical solutions but duplication still occurs in practice. In this paper we report on a case study of how and why duplication occurs in a large organization, and discuss generalizable lessons learned from this. Our case study research questions are why data gets duplicated, what the size of the negative effects of duplication is, and why existing solutions are not used. We frame our findings in terms of design rationale and explain them by providing a causal model. Our findings suggest that next to technological factors, organizational and project factors have a large effect on duplication. We discuss the implications of our findings for technical solutions in general.},

abstract="This paper reviews the history of AI {\&} Law research from the perspective of argument schemes. It starts with the observation that logic, although very well applicable to legal reasoning when there is uncertainty, vagueness and disagreement, is too abstract to give a fully satisfactory classification of legal argument types. It therefore needs to be supplemented with an argument-scheme approach, which classifies arguments not according to their logical form but according to their content, in particular, according to the roles that the various elements of an argument can play. This approach is then applied to legal reasoning, to identify some of the main legal argument schemes. It is also argued that much AI {\&} Law research in fact employs the argument-scheme approach, although it usually is not presented as such. Finally, it is argued that the argument-scheme approach and the way it has been employed in AI {\&} Law respects some of the main lessons to be learnt from Toulmin's The Uses of Argument.",

In work, sport, conversation or hobby, you have experienced, yourself, the suspension of time, the freedom of complete absorption in activity. This is "flow," an experience that is at once demanding and rewarding--an experience that Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi demonstrates is one of the most enjoyable and valuable experiences a person can have. The exhaustive case studies, controlled experiments and innumerable references to historical figures, philosophers and scientists through the ages prove Csikszentmihalyi's point that flow is a singularly productive and desirable state. But the implications for its application to society are what make the book revolutionary.} {The bestselling introduction to "flow"--a groundbreaking psychological theory that shows readers how to improve the quality of life.

ABSTRACT = {We present a two-sorted algebra, called a {\em Peirce
algebra}, of relations and sets interacting with each other.  In a
Peirce algebra, sets can combine with each other as in a Boolean
algebra, relations can combine with each other as in a relation algebra,
and in addition we have both a set-forming operator on relations (the
Peirce product of Boolean modules) and a relation-forming operator on
sets (a cylindrification operation). Two applications of Peirce algebras
are given. The first points out that Peirce algebras provide a natural
algebraic framework for modelling certain programming constructs. The
second shows that the so-called {\em terminological logics} arising in
knowledge representation have evolved a semantics best described as a
calculus of relations interacting with sets.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper deals with terminological representation
languages for {\sc kl-one}-type knowledge representation systems.  Such
languages are based on the two primitive syntactic types called concepts
and roles, which are usually represented model-theoretically as sets and
binary relations respectively.  Rather than following the
model-theoretic route, we show that the semantics can be naturally
accommodated in the context of an equational algebra of relations
interacting with sets.  Equational logic is then a natural vehicle for
computing subsumptions, both of concepts and of roles.  We thus propose
the {\em algebraic} rather than model-theoretic computation of
subsumption.  }

  abstract = {This reissue of the modern classic on the study of argumentation features
	a new Introduction by the author. A central theme throughout the
	impressive series of philosophical books and articles Stephen Toulmin
	has published since 1948 is the way in which assertions and opinions
	concerning all sorts of topics, brought up in everyday life or in
	academic research, can be rationally justified. Is there one universal
	system of norms, by which all sorts of arguments in all sorts of
	fields must be judged, or must each sort of argument be judged according
	to its own norms? In The Uses of Argument (1958) Toulmin sets out
	his views on these questions for the first time. In spite of initial
	criticisms from logicians and fellow philosophers, The Uses of Argument
	has been an enduring source of inspiration and discussion to students
	of argumentation from all kinds of disciplinary background for more
	than forty years.},
