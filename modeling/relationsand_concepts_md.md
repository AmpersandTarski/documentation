# Relations & Concepts

A fact is a statement that is True. *Joe Smith lives in New York* could be a fact. In this example, *Joe Smith* could be seen as an instance of a **Person** and *New York* as an instance of **City**. 

We can define the **relation** *lives in* between the **concepts** *Person* and *City* to hold facts about persons living in cities.
