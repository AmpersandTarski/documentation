# Domain modeling

## Problems

Which problems can be solved with conceptual modeling?

1. To define the boundaries of individual services. A domain model should make these boundaries clear, to develop components as independently as possible.
2. To avoid misunderstandings over terminology. Projects with multiple stakeholders often document their own vocabulary. However, practice shows that this does not suffice to avoid problems with words. A domain model should consolidate consensus and make misunderstandings explicit and debatable before they do harm.
3. Learning. A learner must familiarize herself with new words and specific phrases. Making a domain model improves both the speed and depth of learning.

   2. relevant areas of expertise, such as insurance, security, legal, management, etc.
   3. business functions, such as invoicing, applying for a job, computing rates, etc.

   In essence, this step yields three lists.
