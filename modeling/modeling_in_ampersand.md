# Modeling in Ampersand (under construction by Stef)
To specify an information system, the following steps are necessary:
1. Agreement on the domain language;
2. Agreement on rules;
3. Validate rules;
4. Define interfaces.

## What is a model about?
An ampersand model describes the rules, relations and concepts that define a business system. Using this specification, a software system can be built that can hold structured information as a set of facts. Based on the rules, the set of facts can be checked automatically to detect violations of rules. 

In an Ampersand model, interfaces can be defined too, enabling the definition of changes to the set of facts.

- Define relations and concepts
- Define rules
- Define interfaces
- Define transactions
 
Ampersand can cope with relations and concepts to define a data-space. It also allows the definition of rules to delimit the data-space and to define business processes. It allows the definition of interfaces and it employs the front-end to embody the interfaces as user-interfaces in a webapplication in a standardized manner.
