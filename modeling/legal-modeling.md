  The law is full of rules. Rules that govern the business processess of many
  organizations, both in the public sector and beyond. So why not use these

# Legal modeling

## Purpose

The purpose of legal modeling is usually software related. The most popular use is to obtain decision rules that can be executed by a computer. A much mentioned problem is the legal language of the legislative domain that is being modeled. A modeler who is unfamiliar with the domain language will require trial and error to formulate decision rules that ar both executable and legally compliant. Another problem is that the modeler is sometimes legally educated, sometimes technically educated, but rarely both. It requires a modeler who is both technically and legally competent to make this trial-and-error process converge. This explains why legal modeling can be very time consuming.
